# SubstitutionCipher

The Substitution Cipher program is a Java-based application designed to encode or decode messages stored in text files by shifting the characters by a specified amount. It supports both uppercase and lowercase letters, maintaining their case while handling wraparounds for shifts that exceed the bounds of the alphabet. Non-alphabetical characters, such as punctuation, numbers, and whitespace, remain unchanged during the transformation. The program processes files by reading from an input file, applying the cipher transformation, and writing the result to an output file, creating the output file if it does not already exist. It features a menu-driven interface that allows users to encode a file, decode a file, or quit the program. Users are prompted for input until valid choices or file paths are provided, ensuring smooth operation. The application is interactive and robust, offering a simple yet effective implementation of a substitution cipher.
